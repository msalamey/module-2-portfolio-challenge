# module-2-portfolio-challenge

In this assignment I created a website displaying projects that could be viewed by a potential employer to review my deployed portfolio of work samples. 

## Actions taken: 
* Created a website, including my (developer's) name, a recent photo, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how I can be contacted.
* Included a navigation bar that directs to the corresponding section on the webpage, which includes the work samples; with the first completed project having the largest photo. 
* Utilized flex and media properites so that the website display adjusts accordingly depending on the size of the viewport.
